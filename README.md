# Computer-Vision-MiniProjects

Computer Vision Projects: 
</br> 1) Edge Detection: There are several kernels in option for edge detection and in this repo. we will work on Kirsch operator. 
</br> 2) Face Recognition: Face recognition using HOG feature extraction and machine learning algorithms. 
</br> 3) Leaf Classification: There are several classes of citrus-leaves and for that constructing a CNN model for classification.
